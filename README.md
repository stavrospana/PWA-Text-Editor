# Module 19 Weekly Challenge - Progressive Web Application Text Editor

## Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of advanced data-persistence techniques and asset caching. It showcases the capability to transform a website into a 'Progressive Web Application' (PWA), providing users with a desktop application or mobile app-like experience.

Upon launching the application, a basic text editor interface will be presented. Any text entered in this editor is automatically saved in the cache, ensuring data persistence even when the page is closed. Additionally, users have the option to install the application as a PWA by clicking the 'Install' button in the top left corner and subsequently accepting the installation prompt in the top right corner. Please be aware that not all browsers support this PWA installation functionality.

## Local Installation

For local deployment, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository files and extract them to a designated folder.
2. Navigate to the repository using a Git Bash shell (or equivalent) and execute the command `npm run install` to install the application's dependencies.
3. Proceed with the command `npm run start` to build the webpack dist folder and initiate the application.

Open a web browser and go to "http://localhost:3001/" to access the locally deployed application.
